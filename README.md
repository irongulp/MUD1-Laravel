# MUD1
Essex MUD1 by Trubshaw and Bartle

This is a branch of the 1986 BCPL, MACRO-10, and game source files for MUD refactored in Laravel so that the game can be played in a web browser.

There is still some further understanding needed as this mud86 source handles WIZ MODE differently to the mud84 tape and looks for a file that does not currently exist. Still, you can create personas and play the game.

Key differences in game between mud84 (tape) and mud86 (Stamford) version are that fireworks are a thing various events like death are handled differntly so you don't need multiple dead rooms. Hence, this mud86 has 420 rooms compared to 435 rooms in mud84.

	There are 6 spells available, SUMMON, FORCE, WHERE, CHANGE, SLEEP and
WISH. Anyone may attempt to cast any number of them, with the chance of success
based on some percentage times their level of experience (novice=1 to
witch/wizard=10). If success is indicated, the victim, if any, has a chance to
resist based on the same calculation. If this works, then you will be told and
the effects will occur; otherwise you'll get a failure message, possibly hinting
at what magical item would let you do it every time. Furthermore, the power of
the magic might put you to sleep.

SUMMON <name>		4%	Make <name> drop all and teleport to you.
FORCE <name> , <command>	4%	Make <name> do the <command> .
